You have been tasked with providing a labeling recommendation for a new compound - `pageimab`.

A population PK model has been developed and written in mrgsolve based on pharmacokinetics 
explored in ascending dose studies looking at BID (every 12 hours) dosing ranging from 250-1500 mg, with 250, 500, and 1000 mg tablets available.


Consultation with your clinical collegues has identified that the ideal therapeutic range for the steady-state
trough values is between 8-25 mg/L. 

Likewise, to maintain adequate safety and efficacy profile for commercial
success, 85% of patients given a weight range of 40-140 kg must be within that window.

Use mrgsolve to develop a dosing recommendation.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(PKPDmisc)
library(mrgsolve)
```

```{r}
pmod <- mread_cache("pageimab", "../models/")
```
