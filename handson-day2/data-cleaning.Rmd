# Data cleaning

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(PKPDmisc)
```

```{r}
dirty_data <- read_csv("../data/dirty_data.csv")
```

Reformat the data to be a tidy dataset - 'long' instead of wide,
with time a numeric column of hours. Likewise, split up IDS into two
columns, ID and SITE, where ID is just the numeric ID (eg ID001 --> 1)


Calculate percent change from baseline for each ID at each site


Which individual(s) had the largest positive and negative percent change from baseline?
