# Diagnostic Plots

```

* Create a Res vs Time function with loess fits for the central tendency and the spread (hint abs() is your friend for the spread). 
    * Conditionally allow the loess curve of central tendency to appear, 
    with a default of TRUE. 
    * Users should be able to specify the residual column name.
    * update your function to flag any point over some threshold as red, with a default of absolute difference of > 2.5 


1) read in the csv dataset:

* Residuals

1) Plot CWRES vs time after dose (TAD)

2) Plot WRES vs time after dose (TAD)
